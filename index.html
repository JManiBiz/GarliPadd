          GarliPadd is an alternative method of using garlic to lower blood
          pressure. Garlic has many medical benefits including lowering blood
          pressure. However, garlic has a strong and distinct scent. This is why

        <h1>How is GarliPadd made?</h1>
        <p>
          GarliPadd is made from two simple ingredients: garlic and oilve oil.
          The garlic is pressed with our specialty garlic press to extract the
          garlic oil. This extract is higly concentrated and is mixed with olive
          oil to dilute it. The solution is left undisturbed overnight and then
          strained. 5g of the garlic oil extract is inserted into the adhesive
          polymer layer which is nested between the impermeable backing and the
          release liner.

          <li>
            <h2>How does GarliPadd work?</h2>
            <p>
              GarliPadd works by entering the bloodstream through the skin. Once
              in the bloodstream, it increases the body's production of nitric
              oxide which helps the blood vessels to relax and dilate which
              lowers blood pressure.
